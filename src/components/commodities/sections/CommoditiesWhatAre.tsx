      <p className="mb-4">
        A commodity is a raw material or agricultural product that can be bought or sold on the open market.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Commodities can be split into two categories: soft commodities and hard commodities. Soft commodities are typically agricultural products such as cocoa, coffee, sugar, wheat, cotton, and soybeans. Hard commodities are extracted from the earth, such as various precious metals (gold, silver, palladium, iron ore, copper) and energy products (oil, natural gas, uranium).
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The price of a commodity, like the price of any other good or product, is determined by supply and demand. However, there are unique factors that can influence the price of various commodities. For example, agricultural products will be heavily affected by weather conditions (drought, heavy rains, and natural disasters).
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Other products, such as oil, might see significant price swings due to geopolitical factors, such as a conflict or war occurring in a major oil-producing country. Oil prices are also heavily influenced by the decisions made by OPEC, a cartel consisting of some of the worldÂ´s major oil-producing countries.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Commodities often serve as key components in various goods (for example, lithium is used in mobile phone production) and are standardised for quality and quantity, which makes them easier to trade.
