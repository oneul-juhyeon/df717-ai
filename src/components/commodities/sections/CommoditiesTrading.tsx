        When you trade a commodity, you are speculating on the price change of a raw physical asset, like gold or oil. Many factors, especially supply and demand, will impact the market price.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        Understanding the market players and their goals is the first step in comprehending what commodities trading is.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        There are millions of traders and corporations taking part in commodities trading worldwide with various goals, but we can split them into two broad categories: Hedgers and speculators.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Hedgers</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        A hedger is an individual or company that trades in the physical and derivatives markets. Most hedgers are commodity producers, wholesalers, and retailers of manufactured goods. They all have one thing in common: they are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        To mitigate this risk, they use financial derivatives such as futures. Their goal is not to profit from speculation but rather to avoid a negative consequence caused by price volatility in the commodities they deal with.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        Imagine a farmer who is storing a quantity of corn, due to a large harvest. By the time he sells it, the price of corn might increase or decrease. To protect himself from those price fluctuations, the farmer can sell corn on the futures exchange. If prices go down, he will earn less from the sale of his physical corn, but the profit he makes from his position in the futures market will offset that. If prices go up, his futures position will cause a loss, but he will earn more from the sales of the physical corn.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        As a result, hedgers do not actively look to profit from the futures market. Instead, they aim to safeguard themselves against adverse price changes.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Speculators</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Speculators are a vast category that includes everything from retail traders managing their savings to multibillion-dollar hedge funds. They all have the same goal: to make money by predicting price fluctuations. Speculators are significant market participants because their operations increase liquidity and improve market efficiency.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What causes the price of commodities to change?</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Supply and demand:</strong> The fundamental rule of the market is that as demand rises, so will commodity prices. This is related to income and population, commodity production costs, and the actions of governments and producer organisations.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Commodity production:</strong> The production of commodities is influenced by natural factors like weather and crop conditions, cultivation land, trade constraints, subsidies, taxes, and production-related factors like labour patterns and the development of farming tools and technologies.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Cost of production:</strong> Commodity production costs include raw materials, labour, research and development, insurance, licencing fees, taxes, and much more. An increase in production costs will directly impact the price of the commodity being produced.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Economic growth:</strong> The prosperity of a country indicates the purchasing power of its population. This effect is more obvious in countries that are major producers or consumers. As the economy grows and urbanises, people typically consume more commodities.
