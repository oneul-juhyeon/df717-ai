      <p className="mb-8 text-left">
        Forex, short for 'foreign exchange,' refers to the global market where currencies are bought and sold. In simple terms, forex means changing one currency for another. For example, if you have ever taken an overseas holiday and swapped the currency you normally use for the local currency of the place you are visiting, that's a forex transaction in action!

      <p className="mb-8 text-left">
        Of course, forex (also known as 'FX') is much more than just holiday money. In fact, the forex market is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, with trillions of dollars flowing through it every day. From international business payments to individuals ordering online goods from overseas, foreign exchange is one of the keys to global commerce and investment across every country and currency, from the Baht to the Yuan.
