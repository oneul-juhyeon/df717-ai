        Forex trading offers key advantages when viewed against other forms of investment, like stocks. These include:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-left">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>24-hour trading:</strong> The forex market operates around the clock, meaning you can jump in and out of the markets when it suits you. This can be especially helpful for those looking to generate a side income while working another job, particularly with help from trading robots (also known as Expert Advisors, or EAs) which can run trades automatically and reduce the need for manual intervention.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Leverage:</strong> With forex trading, you can take advantage of leverage to control larger value positions with a relatively small amount of capital. However, you must remember that leverage increases both potential profits and losses, so it should be used with caution.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>High liquidity:</strong> The forex market's large size and liquidity ensure you can enter and exit trades quickly at current market prices with a reduced risk of slippage.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Diversification:</strong> There are a lot of different global currency pairs to pick from, which means the forex market provides a wide range of trading opportunities. Whatever the trend and whatever market events are taking place, there is always a currency in play.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Find opportunities in any market direction:</strong> Because forex trading is done through CFDs and you only trade price movements rather than invest in the underlying product, you can trade when the price of a currency pair is going up or down.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Accessibility:</strong> If you have a computer or mobile device and an internet connection, it is likely you can access what you need to start trading forex. Online brokers offer user-friendly trading platforms, educational resources, and demo accounts.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Learning and development:</strong> Learning to trade forex can be a mentally stimulating and rewarding activity. From analysis techniques to market dynamics, the effects of geopolitics on prices, and algorithmic coding, there is always something to learn.
        </li>
      </ul>
