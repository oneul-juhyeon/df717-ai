        In today's highly interconnected and globalised economy, the prices of trading instruments, including forex pairs, are constantly moving and fluctuating.

        Trading volume and transactions in the FX markets are always affected by supply and demand, and, like any other financial market, the higher the demand for a currency, the higher its price will move. But there are also many other key factors that can affect the prices of currency pairs. Some of these include:

        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Central bank decisions:</strong> Central banks across the globe are responsible for setting interest rate levels for each country. In the forex trading market, traders generally prefer currencies with high-interest rates compared to other currencies. If trading forex, it's a good idea to monitor the central banks related to the 'major' currency pairs: the US Federal Reserve, Bank of England (BoE), Bank of Canada (BoC), European Central Bank (ECB), Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Bank of Japan (BoJ), Swiss National Bank (SNB), and Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ).
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Economic data:</strong> Employment numbers, gross domestic product (GDP) levels, inflation, business sentiment, and consumer sentiment, all tend to affect the movement in currency pairs. Monitoring the economic calendar and market trends on your online trading platform helps keep you up to date with major economic data releases.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Trading sessions:</strong> It is commonly known that trading volumes and activities can be 'thin' or slow during the market open in the Japan/Asia time zone. Trading volumes and activities usually increase when the UK/Europe session begins, and liquidity will be at its peak towards the close of the UK and the open of the US session. The London and New York sessions are usually the most active due to the time overlap between these major financial hubs. During certain forex market hours, some currencies are more liquid, e.g., JPY during the Tokyo session or GBP during the London session.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Geopolitical factors:</strong> Wars, political crises, global unrest, and other related events can also impact the foreign exchange markets. Some currencies tend to do well when there is an elevated level of uncertainty in the markets, while others go in the opposite direction.
