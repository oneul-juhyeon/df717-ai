                Like any form of investment, forex trading carries inherent risk. The volatility of currency markets can lead to significant price fluctuations, which can result in potential gains or losses. Traders can help mitigate risk by using well-defined trading strategies, appropriate risk management techniques, a disciplined approach, and a sound understanding of the financial markets and market conditions.

                Retail traders access the forex market by using a broker, a business that facilitates a specialised trading service that includes access to liquidity, trading platforms, and support. In general, there are three main types of brokers:

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-left mt-2">
                <li className="mb-1">Market makers act as a counterparty to retail traders. In this arrangement, a trader's loss is a broker's gain, and vice versa.</li>
                <li className="mb-1">Electronic Communications Network (ECN) is used by major banks and financial institutions that provide price feeds to an ECN liquidity "pool." Brokers access this ECN pool, pass on the best bid, and offer prices, which often results in low spreads for traders.</li>
                <li className="mb-1">Straight Through Processing (STP) brokers work similarly to ECN brokers by connecting traders to liquidity providers. The main difference is that STP brokers have individual connections to liquidity providers.</li>

                No, you do not need to invest a large amount of money to start forex trading. It is possible to start trading forex with as little as $10. However, some platforms do require a higher amount of capital, sometimes up to a minimum of $500.

              <p className="text-left mt-2">
                The reason you can get started with lesser amounts is because you can use leverage to increase your initial investment. Leverage can be used to take small positions and gain exposure to positions with a larger total value. However, you must be aware that while leverage increases the potential for larger profits from a smaller investment, it also increases the potential for larger losses. The higher the leverage you use, the higher the risk, but ultimately, the amount you choose to trade is up to you.

The forex market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, allowing most traders to choose trading hours that suit their schedule. While modern trading apps and trade management tools make it easier to do analysis at your convenience, sufficient time should be factored in for trade analysis, monitoring, market updates, and other key responsibilities.

                Every currency has its own three-digit currency code (e.g., GBP for the Great British Pound and USD for the US dollar). A forex trade involves two currencies, referred to as a currency pair. The price of the first currency is expressed in terms of the second.

              <p className="text-left mt-2">
                Once you have decided which two currencies you want to trade, calculate how much of the quoted (second) currency is needed to purchase one unit of the base (first) currency.

                For example, assume one Australian dollar (AUD) at the current market price is equal to $1.04 Singapore dollars (SGD). Your trade is represented as AUD/SGD, where AUD is the base currency and SGD is the quote currency.

                Many traders acquire the skills necessary to trade forex by combining self-education, practise, and ongoing learning. To learn the fundamentals of forex trading and how the markets function, you can use instructional tools like tutorials, webinars, videos, how-to articles, and analysis. These materials, many of which are free, can be used as a starting point for deeper research into specialised fields such as market analysis, trading techniques, risk management, and trading psychology.

                Short for 'Percentage in Points', the 'pip' is a change in the value of a currency that is reflected in the fourth decimal point. For example, if the SGD is valued at $0.9630 and increases by two 'pips', it will then be valued at $0.9632 against the Australian dollar.

                A 'lot' in forex trading refers to the number of units of a base currency. A standard lot is equal to 100,000 units of the base currency in a forex trade pair. You can also trade mini, micro, and nano lots, which are 10,000, 1,000, and 100 units, respectively. For example, trade a standard lot in Australian dollars, and the value of the trade would be AUD $100,000.

                Leverage in forex trading allows you to accept trades with a higher value than the quantity of money in your trading account. If the leverage ratio is 5:1, for example, it indicates that you can trade with 5 times the capital you have deposited. For instance, if the account has $1,000 in it, the trader could execute trades worth a total of $5,000.
              </p>
              <p className="text-left mt-2">
                This configuration has the potential to maximise returns while simultaneously amplifying losses. In the end, you decide how much leverage to use on every given trade, and you can adjust the amount of leverage you plan to use on a trade before you place it.

              <p className="text-left mt-2">
                It's important to note that when trading with leverage, you are also subjected to margin requirements. If your balance falls below the margin requirement, your positions will automatically close at a loss.

                Margin is effectively a downpayment on a leveraged trade. You can think of it as being like purchasing a home with a mortgage, where you need to put down a percentage of the total amount to make the purchase.
              </p>
              <p className="text-left mt-2">
                To use leverage on a forex trade, you may need to put down a margin of a few percent. For example, your FX broker may offer 10:1 leverage if you agree to put down a $1,000 margin. So, the trade can take place using only 10 percent of your own money to trade a standard lot of 100,000 units.
              </p>
              <p className="text-left mt-2">
                In this case, the trader would need to deposit money into their margin account before any trades could be made.

              <p className="text-left mt-2">
                You will see a separate purchase price and a sell price when you plan to make a trade on your trading platform. Simply deduct the ask/sell price from the bid/buy price to determine the spread. The difference is typically extremely slight; for instance, a currency pair's buy price might be 1.1529 while its sale price might be 1.1523. As a result, the spread will be 6 pips, or 0.0006. Traders favour brokers who pass on the smallest spreads.

                Economies around the world are constantly changing and are influenced by factors such as changes in government, trade deals, resources, consumer confidence, and conflicts. Events such as unemployment figure announcements in Canada and the latest mortgage application numbers in the UK can impact the foreign exchange market. A speech made by the US President can impact the foreign exchange rate, as can property price changes in Australia.

                Knowing about major announcements beforehand can help you succeed as a trader because the events may provide clues as to how certain currency pairings will move.
