      <p className="mb-4 text-left">
        Indices give you the opportunity to trade the direction of the stock market as a whole.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-left">
        For example, if you expect that the US is heading towards a recession and that the domestic stock market will decline, it would be inefficient, inconvenient, and expensive to enter short positions on many individual stocks. Instead, you could place a single CFD short position on the Dow Jones 30 and profit from any potential downturn in the index.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-left">
        Indices also provide diversification. You may feel comfortable trading only one asset class (like forex), but if you find yourself in a situation where your strategy is not working anymore, for example, due to a lack of volatility, it could be an opportunity to test your strategy on other products.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8 text-left">
        Indices are highly liquid, which means they are suitable both for short-term and long-term trading.
      </p>
