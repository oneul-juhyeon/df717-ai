      <h2 className="text-3xl mt-8 mb-4">What are stocks?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-left">
        Stocks are a type of security that represents ownership or equity interest in a company. In the world of finance, stocks are also known as shares or equities. Stock ownership may entitle stockholders to dividend payments or voting rights on a company's corporate policies.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8 text-left">
        The ownership of stocks is established on a per-share basis. Therefore, the owners are often referred to as shareholders or stockholders.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">What is the difference between stocks and shares?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-left">
        Are stocks and shares the same thing? It's a fair question because many people tend to confuse stocks and shares. Although the two terms are often used interchangeably, there are some differences between them.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-left">
        Buying shares basically means you own part of a company. The term stock is a more generic term and is commonly used to refer to a specific company. Here's an example of how such a phrase would be typically used:
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-left">
        Trader A: Hey! Which stocks do you have in your portfolio?<br />
        Trader B: Oh, I've got Google and Facebook.<br />
        So, using the above example, this is how it might continue:
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-left">
        Trader A: Oh, that's cool. How many shares of Google did you buy?<br />
        Trader B: I bought 100 shares of Google.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-left">
        The term "shares", however, refers to a specific stock's quantity.
      </p>
    </>
  );
};
