      <p className="mb-4">
        Gold has proven to be a reliable way to preserve wealth. While the price of gold fluctuates and occasionally experiences considerable 
        volatility, the value and purchasing power of the precious metal has steadily increased over time. This is enhanced by the consistent 
        demand for gold, which stems from its use in the production of jewellery as well as industrial and technological applications.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Gold is universally recognised and holds its value regardless of a specific currency. It has historically served as a solid hedge 
        against inflation and currency devaluation, both of which erode not only investor gains but also general purchasing power. When the 
        stock market is in turmoil and cash is losing value owing to low interest rates, gold can become an appealing asset class for investors, 
        offsetting losses in other investments.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Because gold is highly liquid, buyers can quickly locate sellers without significantly impacting the price. This is significant because 
        it reduces transaction costs and gives traders and investors confidence that they will be able to enter and exit positions quickly. 
        Even the physical gold market is liquid, as it is not difficult to find a buyer.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Gold is an excellent diversification tool that can help minimise overall portfolio risk. It has historically had a negative correlation 
        with stocks and bonds, but it can outperform the stock market at select periods, such as when there is widespread risk aversion.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Trading gold is accessible to retail traders and institutional investors alike. The large range of available financial instruments, 
        including CFDs, stocks, and ETFs, as well as the multitude of available online trading platforms, enable traders worldwide to engage 
        in the market, regardless of an investor's portfolio size or risk profile.
