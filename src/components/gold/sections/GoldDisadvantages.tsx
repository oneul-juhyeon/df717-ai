      <p className="mb-4">
        Although gold prices rise in the long term, they can be highly volatile in the short run, driven by news, data releases, 
        and economic and geopolitical events. Trading gold requires careful risk management, especially when using leverage.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Gold, unlike stocks and bonds (and even cash), does not produce a yield or dividend. Aside from the potential for capital 
        appreciation, gold does not generate additional income for traders. As a result, investors who value regular, consistent income 
        streams may find gold trading less enticing, particularly in periods of price consolidation. Returns might be low during "risk-on" 
        periods when investors flock to riskier assets.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Investors who choose to retain physical gold in the form of bars or coins must provide secure storage facilities or invest in 
        safe deposit boxes. These storage costs can cut into the overall return on investment.
