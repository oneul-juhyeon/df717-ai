      <p className="mb-4">
        Several factors make gold an ideal asset for trading:
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        First, there is a wide range of trading instruments available, all of which are easily accessible through online trading platforms. 
        Retail investors with varied levels of capital can enter this market, unlike other investments, which require large capital resources.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The global gold market is characterised by strong liquidity, allowing traders to easily enter and exit their positions.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Finally, gold is seen as a safe-haven asset, making it an appealing addition to any balanced portfolio. In times of economic 
        instability and geopolitical turmoil, it tends to keep its value and even appreciate. Consequently, while traditional markets 
        come under pressure, gold traders can use their trading strategies to find opportunities from price fluctuations.
