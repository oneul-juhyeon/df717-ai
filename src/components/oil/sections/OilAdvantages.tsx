      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Advantages of trading oil</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
        <li>
          <strong className="font-bold">Accessibility:</strong> Oil CFD trading provides easy access to the oil market for individuals without the need for 
          physical ownership of the commodity. Traders can speculate on oil price movements without the logistical challenges of handling physical oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="font-bold">Leverage:</strong> CFD trading allows traders to take advantage of leverage, which means you can control a larger position 
          with a smaller amount of capital. This amplifies potential profits (and losses) compared to the initial investment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="font-bold">Diverse trading opportunities:</strong> Oil is a global commodity with substantial market liquidity, which offers a wide range 
          of possibilities. Traders can speculate on different types of oil, such as Brent crude, WTI crude, or other regional grades.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="font-bold">Market volatility:</strong> The oil market is known for its volatility, which presents traders with opportunities to profit 
          from price fluctuations. Increased volatility can lead to greater potential returns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="font-bold">Long and short positions:</strong> CFD trading allows traders to take both long (buy) and short (sell) positions. This means 
          you can profit from both rising and falling oil prices by speculating on the direction of the market.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="font-bold">Hedging:</strong> Trading oil as a hedging instrument can be a useful way to diversify and balance risk in an investment portfolio.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="font-bold">Flexibility:</strong> Oil CFD trading offers flexibility in terms of trade sizes, allowing traders to enter positions with smaller 
          amounts of capital compared to traditional futures contracts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="font-bold">24/5 market access:</strong> The oil CFD market operates 24 hours a day, 5 days a week, providing a range of trading opportunities 
          across different time zones. Traders can react to global events and news that impact oil prices without being limited by exchange hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="font-bold">Risk management tools:</strong> CFD trading platforms typically offer risk management tools such as stop-loss and take-profit orders. 
          These tools allow traders to set predetermined levels to limit potential losses or secure profits automatically.
