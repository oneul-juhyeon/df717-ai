      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Why trade oil?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Trading oil offers several benefits when compared to other forms of trading and investment.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Firstly, oil is a highly liquid market, so it is relatively easy to enter and exit trades. And because oil prices are influenced by global events, 
        there is a high likelihood that a major event or piece of news somewhere along the supply or demand chain will create price fluctuations and 
        therefore trading opportunities.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Additionally, because oil is such a vital commodity across the world, consistent demand is effectively assured, and the potential for profit 
        remains. Moreover, oil trading allows for diversification as it is less correlated to traditional financial markets such as stocks and indices.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Lastly, because oil can be traded as a CFD, there is no requirement to own any physical product. When combined with leverage, traders can 
        amplify their potential returns. Note, however, that leveraged trading also amplifies any potential losses.
