        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Lack of regulation:</strong> Because the cryptocurrency market is mostly unregulated, there is a risk of uncertainty and accountability in the event of adverse events or market conditions.

        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Cybersecurity risks:</strong> Cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallets may be vulnerable to hacking and other security breaches, potentially putting traders' assets at risk.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Complexity:</strong> The recent technology behind cryptocurrencies can be complex, making it difficult for novice traders to understand and navigate.
