      <p className="mb-4">
        Trading cryptocurrencies has several advantages over traditional forms of financial investment, including:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>High volatility:</strong> The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, which means there are opportunities for significant gains if you get it right. Note that high volatility can also raise the risk of losses.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Provided you meet the criteria to open a trading account with a broker, cryptocurrency trading is accessible to anyone with an internet connection and a computer or smartphone.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>24/7 trading:</strong> Unlike some markets, which close at the end of a trading day and remain closed overnight, the decentralised crypto markets remain open 24 hours a day.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Low fees:</strong> Cryptocurrency trading fees are often lower than those associated with traditional financial markets.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Decentralisation:</strong> The cryptocurrency market is decentralised, meaning there is no central authority governing it.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Security:</strong> Being built on blockchain technology makes cryptocurrencies inherently secure and resistant to fraud.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Diversification:</strong> Adding cryptocurrencies to an existing investment portfolio can provide diversification, which can be an effective way to help manage risk.
        </li>
