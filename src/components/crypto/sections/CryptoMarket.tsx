      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">What is the crypto market?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The cryptocurrency market is like other well-known financial trading markets such as forex, commodities, and stocks. It consists of a variety of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others, with buyers and sellers trading the items on each side. As the demand for each cryptocurrency fluctuates, so does the price of the underlying asset in the market. Because the cryptocurrency market is open 24 hours a day, prices are continuously shifting.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The cryptocurrency market has a reputation for being volatile and susceptible to significant price movements. This is due to several factors, including:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Regulation:</strong> With the notable exception of the MiCA regulations in Europe (effective by the end of 2024), the cryptocurrency industry is currently mostly unregulated, which means there is no central authority or regulating body that establishes rules concerning the use of crypto. This can result in sudden changes in prices due to news events or market sentiment.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Market sentiment:</strong> In the absence of a governing body, the crypto market is driven by market sentiment, meaning collective changes in investors' perceptions and emotions can lead to sudden price fluctuations.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Supply and demand:</strong> Despite being virtual, cryptocurrencies are designed to be limited in their supply, with some, such as Bitcoin, having a fixed maximum supply. This means that changes in demand for a particular cryptocurrency can lead to significant price movements.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Technological advancements:</strong> Because the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, such as blockchain, is still evolving, new developments can impact the market quickly.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Speculation:</strong> Many people buy and sell cryptocurrencies for speculative purposes, meaning they are less interested in the technology behind the cryptocurrency than they are in making a profit. This can lead to sudden price movements as investors buy and sell based on their expectations rather than market analysis.
