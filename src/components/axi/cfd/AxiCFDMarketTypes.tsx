        <strong>Forex:</strong> Forex or 'FX' is short for foreign exchange, while 'forex trading' refers to the act of buying or selling major, minor, and exotic currency pairs.

        <strong>Stocks:</strong> The stock market is where investors can buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. The largest and most popular stock market in the world is the US stock market, made up of 4,000+ companies from stock exchanges such as the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange), NASDAQ, AMEX, and more. Using CFDs, you can trade a wide range of stocks, including top growth stocks (stocks seen as having high future potential) and value stocks (stocks deemed to be trading below their real worth). Popular growth stocks include top American technology companies, frequently referred to as FAANG: Facebook (META), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPPL), Netflix (NFLX), and Alphabet (GOOG).

        <strong>Indices:</strong> Indices are "baskets" of individual, but related, stocks. For example, the S&P 500 index represents the overall stock performance of 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the USA, while the NDXT (NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index) measures the performance of 100 top technology companies. Indices are usually ranked by independent institutions like the FTSE Group, Deutsche BÃ¶rse, and Standard & Poor's. Some of the most popular indices include the S&P 500, Dow Jones, NYSE, NASDAQ, and FTSE 100.

        <strong>Commodities:</strong> Commodities are common raw materials used in the production of other goods or traded on the open market. Commodities can be split into two categories: soft commodities and hard commodities. Agricultural products, like coffee and cocoa, are considered soft commodities, while precious metals like gold or silver and energy, such as natural gas and oil, are considered hard commodities.

      <li className="mb-4">
        <strong>Cryptocurrencies:</strong> Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are a relatively new form of digital currency powered by decentralised peer-to-peer networks called blockchains. Unlike traditional forms of money issued by central banks, cryptocurrencies are typically not overseen by a government or financial institution and do not require a financial intermediary to operate. Instead, crypto networks are managed by network participants who verify and confirm transactions.

        <strong>Initial Public Offerings (IPOs):</strong> An IPO is the process through which a privately held company offers its shares to the public for the first time and invites potential investors to gain exposure to its shares via a stock exchange. When you trade an IPO with CFDs, you go long (buy) or short (sell) on stock price movements. This means that you have the option to open a short (sell) position on IPO shares, depending on your strategy and the IPO's expected result.
