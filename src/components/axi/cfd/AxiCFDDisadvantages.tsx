      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-left">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Volatility risk:</strong> CFDs can be traded on volatile assets, which can lead to rapid price fluctuations. Sudden market movements can result in substantial losses or trigger margin calls.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Leverage amplifies losses:</strong> While leverage can enhance potential profits, it also magnifies losses. Trading with leverage increases the risk of significant losses, as losses can exceed the initial investment.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Broker risk:</strong> CFD trades are executed with a broker or financial institution, exposing traders to counterparty risk. If the broker fails or goes bankrupt, there is a risk of losing the invested capital or facing difficulties in withdrawing funds. Traders should do their due diligence and choose a licenced, regulated, and reputable broker.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Fees and charges:</strong> Some CFD brokers may have unexpected fees or charges, such as overnight financing costs, commissions, or platform fees. Traders should carefully review the fee structure of their chosen broker to understand the total cost of trading.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Overtrading and emotional decision-making:</strong> The accessibility of CFD trading can lead to overtrading and emotional decision-making. Impulsive trading based on emotions rather than a well-thought-out strategy can result in poor trading outcomes.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Complex pricing structure:</strong> CFD prices in fast-moving markets can be complex and may not always mirror the exact price of the underlying asset. Factors like spreads, commissions, and financing costs can affect the pricing, making it important for traders to understand the pricing structure of CFDs.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Regulatory risks:</strong> The regulatory environment for CFD trading varies across different jurisdictions. Regulatory changes or restrictions imposed by authorities can impact the availability, leverage limits, or other aspects of CFD trading.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Lack of ownership and voting rights:</strong> CFD traders do not own the underlying asset and do not have voting rights in the associated company.</li>
      </ul>
